The extent of the flood appears significant given these descriptions. The damage severity is reported as high, with tweets mentioning 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034), 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), and 'unbelievable damage' (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042). Some reports even compare the 'Texas flood damage from Harvey' to that of Katrina (Tweet ID: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). The absence of 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the time window means the assessment relies solely on social media reports for on-the-ground conditions. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=85%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=75%, Visual=0%",

These reports indicate that a significant portion of the ZIP code was impacted by floodwaters, leading to considerable structural damage to residences. While sensor data on September 10th reported 0.0 inches of water, this likely reflects receding floodwaters rather than an absence of prior flooding, as the focus of the reports is on post-flood damage and assessment. There were no 311 calls found for this location during the specified time window, which limits direct, on-the-ground reports of active flooding or immediate emergencies. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=60%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=45%, Visual=0%\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.33\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: Text evidence: The provided tweets consistently report 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (e.g., Tweet IDs 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872) and ongoing 'flood damage assessments' (Tweet IDs 904837837140484096, 905820640015511552) within ZIP 77048.

Specifically, tweet [903028781920788480] notes 'the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few,' indicating extensive damage across properties. Tweet [903081533124247553] explicitly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot.' The widespread nature of the flooding is further emphasized by reports that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' ([903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], [903992796763348992]).

There were no 311 calls available for this specific ZIP code and time window. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=35%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=40%, Visual=0%\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.38\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: Text evidence: Numerous tweets confirm widespread flood and structural damage in ZIP 77033 following Hurricane Harvey during the specified time window.

Tweet [904837837140484096] specifically points to 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston' within the ZIP code. The Harris County Appraisal District launched a 'Damage Report Feature' for the app, as noted in tweet [905524226022674436], indicating a county-wide effort to assess damage. Additionally, tweet [905820640015511552] mentions 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress.'

          "reasoning": "Text evidence: Analysis of real-time Tweets for ZIP 77630 during the specified time window reveals widespread and severe impact from Hurricane Harvey. Multiple reports confirm 'historic flooding' and 'unprecedented in scale' flood events, indicating a significant flood extent. A specific report mentions residents being 'flooded in and can't get help' at 1507 Chapman St, Orange, TX 77630 (Tweet ID: 902855359995539457), directly confirming residential inundation and impassable conditions. Reports also indicate substantial 'flood damage' and statements like 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), suggesting high structural damage severity. The widespread nature of water damage 'extended far beyond flood zones' (e.g., Tweet ID: 903823717926567936) further supports a high flood extent. The 'death toll' mention (Tweet ID: 902388226442264576) implies severe consequences. While no specific road names were mentioned as impacted, the report of residents being 'flooded in and can't get help' strongly infers that local access roads near 1507 Chapman St were impassable. No 311 calls or relevant sensor data were available for this specific ZIP and time window. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=75%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=80%, Visual=0%",
