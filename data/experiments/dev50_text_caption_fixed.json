Tweets from the area explicitly describe 'historic flooding' and a '1,000-year flood event' ([901826476210876417], [902835549135917056], [903399005224357889]), with one user mentioning being in the flood until it ended ([901629053211480066]). The average structural damage per building in the ZIP is estimated at 50%, reflecting significant and widespread destruction. Reports confirm 'Hurricane Harvey damage' ([901849278003372034]), with specific mention that Harvey 'destroyed a lot' ([903081533124247553]) and caused 'unbelievable damage' ([903656280010711042]). Sensor data from September 10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that later date, not an absence of flooding during the event peak. No specific road impacts were reported.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034\nReasoning: The provided tweets from ZIP 77088 confirm widespread and historic flooding during the specified time window. Multiple tweets, such as [901826476210876417], [902835549135917056], and [903399005224357889], describe Harvey as unleashing 'historic flooding' and being a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' in the Houston area. Tweet [901629053211480066] directly mentions 'till the flood end' within the ZIP, indicating active flooding. Regarding damage, tweets like [901849278003372034] explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage'. More severely, tweet [903081533124247553] states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot', indicating significant structural losses. Other tweets like [901917030970003457], [901952108655775744], [902933605168685056], [902967918874562560], and [903656280010711042] refer to 'flood damage' and 'unbelievable damage'. Although no specific building counts are provided, the strong language ('destroyed a lot', 'unbelievable damage', 'spared few' from a nearby area [903028781920788480]) implies a high average damage per building across the ZIP. The sensor data showing 0.0 inches on September 10 is consistent with water having receded by that post-event date, not with an absence of flooding during the August 26-September 1 query window. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted.",

There was also a report of a power outage ([902555174073499650]). While some tweets mention flood damage in the Theater District or Bellaire, the general consensus of 'destroyed a lot' and 'unbelievable damage' within the context of reports originating from or about 77018 supports significant local impact. The sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates that floodwaters had receded by that date, which is consistent with the post-peak flooding period, and does not contradict earlier flooding reports.",

A specific report from Tweet [902539673364516864] confirmed that 'Knotty Oaks Trail' was flooded and a power 'transform blowed' at 4622 Knotty Oaks Trail. Multiple tweets, including [901849278003372034] and [903081533124247553], explicitly referred to 'Hurricane Harvey damage' and that Harvey 'destroyed a lot' within the Houston area, suggesting substantial impact across the ZIP. The regional context, with references to 'historic flooding' and comparisons to Katrina's damage (Tweets [901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]), supports the conclusion of widespread impact. Based on these on-the-ground reports, approximately 45% of the ZIP area is estimated to have been covered by floodwater, with an average damage severity of 25% per building. Sensor data from September 10 showed water had receded, but does not indicate conditions during the event.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.75\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034\nReasoning: Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that date and does not reflect conditions during the query time window (Aug 25-31). Analysis relies heavily on real-time tweets. Multiple tweets from ZIP 77045 during the event describe widespread and historic flooding across Houston. Specifically, Tweet [902539673364516864] reported a 'street flooded' at '4622 knotty oaks trail 77045' and a 'transform blowed,' indicating direct flood impact and infrastructure damage within the ZIP. Other tweets, such as [901849278003372034], explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage,' while [903081533124247553] states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot.' The sentiment expressed in tweets like [901479837122125825] ('Harvey is coming and will flood you area badly cause damage') and the comparison to Katrina's damage ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]) suggest a high degree of anticipated and actual severity. While no specific building counts are provided, the direct report of a flooded street and power infrastructure damage, combined with widespread mentions of 'historic flooding' and 'damage' within the ZIP, points to a significant flood extent and moderate average damage.",

Tweets directly confirm active flooding ('till the flood end', ID 901629053211480066) and describe widespread 'historic flooding in Houston area' (ID 901826476210876417). The flood extent is further corroborated by reports that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (IDs 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992), implying a substantial portion of the ZIP was inundated. Damage severity is inferred from general statements like 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (IDs 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744), 'Harvey destroyed a lot' (ID 903081533124247553), and 'unbelievable damage' (ID 903656280010711042). Specific addresses within 77021 (4931 Gammage St, 4927 Gammage St) reported needing power back (ID 902745578425253888), indicating direct impact on properties. The sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water recession and does not contradict the flooding reported during the earlier, active period (Aug 27 - Sept 2). No specific roads were mentioned as impacted within the ZIP, nor were any 311 calls provided.",

Specific areas mentioned with flood damage include the 'Theater District Houston' (902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560) and the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area' (904837837140484096). The phrase 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (903081533124247553) and 'Harvey spared few' in Bellaire (903028781920788480, reported from ZIP 77079) strongly suggest high average damage per building. The consensus from tweets is that water damage was extensive and severe, extending beyond traditional flood zones (903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992). Given the consistent and strong language ('destroyed a lot', 'spared few', 'unbelievable damage'), both flood extent and damage severity are estimated to be high.",

Although sensor data from September 10, 2017 (Sensor IDs: 100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches of water, this indicates that floodwaters had receded by this time, not that flooding didn't happen during the peak event. The 'flood damage assessments in progress' and repeated mentions of 'house damage' confirm the lingering impact of earlier flooding. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted, and no 311 calls were found for this period.",

Multiple tweets explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (e.g., Tweet IDs 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872). There are also reports of 'flood damage assessment in progress' (Tweet IDs 904837837140484096, 905820640015511552) and calls for residents to report flood damage or fill out surveys if their homes were affected (Tweet IDs 905524226022674436, 906567125384364032). This collective evidence confirms that ZIP 77048 was affected by flooding, leading to structural damage to homes. The sensor data for September 10 shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded by this time, which is consistent with the query window being after the peak flooding of August 27-28. No specific road impacts were mentioned in the provided data. The estimates for flood extent and damage severity are based on the widespread nature of damage reports, implying a significant portion of the area was affected, with an average level of damage across all buildings in the ZIP.",

Sensor data from 2017-09-10 shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded significantly by that date, but does not contradict reports of severe flooding during the event. Tweets from within ZIP 77486 and the broader Houston area confirm widespread and historic flooding. Tweet [901826476210876417] on Aug 28, 2017, explicitly states 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area,' while [901859997184802816] on Aug 28, 2017, proclaims 'HOUSTON TEXAS FLOOD HARVEY.' The phrase 'floodingcity' from Tweet [903081533124247553] on Aug 30, 2017, further emphasizes the extensive inundation. Given these reports, it is highly probable that a substantial portion of the ZIP area experienced flooding. Damage reports are also prevalent; Tweet [901849278003372034] on Aug 28, 2017, simply states 'Hurricane Harvey damage,' while [903081533124247553] on Aug 30, 2017, reports 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot.'

Sensor data from 2017-09-10 shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded significantly by that date, but does not contradict reports of severe flooding during the event. Tweets from within ZIP 77486 and the broader Houston area confirm widespread and historic flooding. Tweet [901826476210876417] on Aug 28, 2017, explicitly states 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area,' while [901859997184802816] on Aug 28, 2017, proclaims 'HOUSTON TEXAS FLOOD HARVEY.' The phrase 'floodingcity' from Tweet [903081533124247553] on Aug 30, 2017, further emphasizes the extensive inundation. Given these reports, it is highly probable that a substantial portion of the ZIP area experienced flooding. Damage reports are also prevalent; Tweet [901849278003372034] on Aug 28, 2017, simply states 'Hurricane Harvey damage,' while [903081533124247553] on Aug 30, 2017, reports 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot.' The sentiment 'unbelievable damage' from Tweet [903656280010711042] on Sept 1, 2017, and the observation 'Harvey spared few' in Bellaire (a nearby Houston area) from Tweet [903028781920788480] on Aug 30, 2017, suggest significant and widespread structural harm. While specific counts for ZIP 77486 are not provided, the consistent reporting of 'historic' and 'unbelievable' damage across Houston indicates a high average damage per building in affected areas.",

There were no 311 calls or imagery provided. One tweet [904837837140484096] mentioned 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston', however, as this location is geographically distinct from ZIP 78412, it is not included in the roads impacted for this ZIP.",

        "formatted": "Summary: ZIP 77520 experienced extensive flooding and severe damage from Hurricane Harvey between August 25 and August 31, 2017. Numerous tweets reported 'historic flooding' and described the event as a '1,000-year flood.' On-the-ground accounts confirmed that Hurricane Harvey 'destroyed a lot' of property, with comparisons made to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. Reports indicated that 'Harvey spared few,' suggesting widespread impact on buildings. Based on these reports, it is estimated that approximately 75% of the ZIP area was covered by floodwaters, and the average structural damage per building was around 45%. No specific road impacts were mentioned in the provided data. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, is interpreted as floodwaters having receded by that later date.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066\nReasoning: Tweets from ZIP 77520 during the period of August 25-31, 2017, consistently report significant and widespread flooding and damage due to Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets (Tweet IDs: 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 903081533124247553, 903399005224357889) describe 'historic flooding,' a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale,' and the area as a 'flooding city.' The expectation of severe impact is noted early (Tweet ID: 901479837122125825), with later reports confirming 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034) and stating 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). The extent of damage is further highlighted by comparisons to Hurricane Katrina (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) and observations that 'Harvey spared few' in nearby areas (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480). While sensor data for September 10, 2017, shows 0.0 inches, this is interpreted as water having receded after the peak flooding event, which is consistent with the provided temporal context instructions and the real-time reports of severe flooding during the query window.",

No specific roads were mentioned as impacted in the available reports.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.85\nCited Tweets: 901629053211480066, 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744\nReasoning: Numerous tweets confirm widespread and severe flood damage in ZIP 77521 during the specified time window. Reports include 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034), 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560), and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). One tweet explicitly states 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close... Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), indicating high flood extent and significant damage to most properties. Multiple tweets also highlighted 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (Tweet IDs: 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992), suggesting a very broad area of impact. The sensor data from September 10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water receded by then and does not contradict the severe flooding reported during the query window (August 27 - September 2).
