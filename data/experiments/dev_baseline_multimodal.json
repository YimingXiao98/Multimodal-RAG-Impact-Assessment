Despite some reports of structural damage in the text analysis, visual assessments reveal no visible damage, leading to a structural damage estimate of 10%. The flooding has severely impacted access roads, marking significant infrastructure concerns.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034, 901899756414357508, 901901311779766272\nReasoning: The text analysis reports a significant extent of flooding and mentions structural damage based on citizen reports. However, visual analysis shows widespread flooding with no visible damage, suggesting that any damage reported could be due to inaccessible regions or areas not captured in the imagery. As the visual assessment is direct evidence with high confidence, it is prioritized in estimating the damage severity.",

The text analysis highlights a considerable flood impact and damage severity based on community reporting, despite limited specific details for ZIP 77091. In contrast, the visual analysis indicates no visible flooding or structural damage from the imagery available. Since the visual data's confidence is higher, it guides the structural damage estimate to 0.0%.
