Sensor data (IDs 100, 105, 110) from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates that floodwaters had receded by that date, not that flooding didn't occur during the event. Tweets from within the query window confirm widespread and historic flooding in the Houston area, including ZIP 77010. Tweet IDs 901826476210876417 and 902835549135917056 explicitly mention 'historic flooding' unleashed by Harvey in Houston. Multiple tweets (902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560) specifically report that 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey'. This is a direct report of structural damage to commercial properties within the ZIP. Other tweets (e.g., 901849278003372034, 903081533124247553) broadly refer to 'Hurricane Harvey damage' and that Harvey 'destroyed a lot' in the city. \n\nFor flood_extent_pct, given the confirmed 'historic flooding' and specific reports of damage in a prominent area like the Theater District, it is reasonable to estimate that a significant portion of the ZIP was inundated. Downtown areas, where 77010 is located, are often prone to significant flooding due to high impervious surfaces and proximity to waterways like Buffalo Bayou. A 65% flood extent is estimated to reflect widespread inundation during this historic event.\n\nFor damage_severity_pct, the reports of 'flood damage' in the Theater District indicate direct structural and interior damage to commercial buildings. While specific counts are not provided, the impact on a significant district suggests that a non-negligible average damage occurred across the entire ZIP's building stock, encompassing both commercial and residential properties. Considering the general mentions of 'damage' and 'destroyed a lot' alongside the specific district damage, an average damage of 15% per building is estimated. This accounts for significant damage to some properties, while others might have been less affected or unaffected, averaging out across all buildings in the ZIP.\n\nFor roads_impacted, the 'historic flooding' would inevitably lead to widespread road closures and impassability.

Sensor data from September 10th shows water had receded by that date.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.6\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901826476210876417, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744\nReasoning: Tweets originating from ZIP 77032 during the specified time window consistently report on the widespread and historic impact of Hurricane Harvey, mentioning 'historic flooding' ([901826476210876417], [902835549135917056]) and 'extensive flooding' ([902911818624053248]) across the Houston area. Multiple tweets also directly refer to 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' ([901086383942639617]) and 'flood damage' ([901917030970003457], [901917813392199684], [901952108655775744]). One tweet explicitly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' on August 30th ([903081533124247553]), indicating significant structural damage. While specific building counts or street names within 77032 are not provided, the consistent and strong language ('historic', 'extensive', 'destroyed a lot') from residents within the ZIP indicates a high probability of broad flood extent and substantial damage. The sensor data showing 0.0 inches on September 10th confirms that water had receded by that later date, not that flooding didn't occur during the August 25-31 time window, which aligns with the tweet reports of active flooding during that period. No 311 calls were found for this ZIP.",

Sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that later date and does not reflect conditions during the query window. On-the-ground reports from tweets provide strong evidence of widespread flooding and significant damage within ZIP 77059 during the specified period.\n\nFor flood extent, tweets explicitly mention 'historic flooding in Houston area' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity 8/30/17' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), indicating extensive inundation. Another tweet also refers to waiting 'till the flood end' (Tweet ID: 901629053211480066). This suggests a substantial portion of the ZIP was covered by floodwaters.\n\nFor damage severity, multiple reports confirm significant destruction. 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) points to severe structural damage. The comparison 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) highlights the catastrophic nature of the damage across the region.

A two-day power outage was also reported (Tweet ID: 902311997009743872). Sensor data from September 10 showing 0.0 inches indicates floodwaters had receded by that date.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066\nReasoning: The time window 2017-08-25 to 2017-08-31 directly overlaps with Hurricane Harvey's peak flooding (Aug 27-28, 2017). Sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that later date and does not reflect conditions during the query window. On-the-ground reports from tweets provide strong evidence of widespread flooding and significant damage within ZIP 77059 during the specified period.\n\nFor flood extent, tweets explicitly mention 'historic flooding in Houston area' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity 8/30/17' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), indicating extensive inundation. Another tweet also refers to waiting 'till the flood end' (Tweet ID: 901629053211480066). This suggests a substantial portion of the ZIP was covered by floodwaters.\n\nFor damage severity, multiple reports confirm significant destruction. 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) points to severe structural damage. The comparison 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) highlights the catastrophic nature of the damage across the region. A tweet geo-located in 77059 states, 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), strongly implying widespread severe damage within and around 77059. Reports of 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560) further confirm structural damage. The power outage reported in 77059 for '2 full days' (Tweet ID: 902311997009743872) is an additional impact. Combined, these indicate a high average percentage of damage across buildings.\n\nNo specific roads were mentioned as impacted.",

Tweet ID 902310479695147013, posted on August 29th, explicitly states: 'It's not flooded in my zip code 77061 and we have been without power since Saturday...'. This is the only tweet providing a specific flood status for this particular ZIP code during the event.

No specific roads were identified as impacted.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.6\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: The analysis focuses on reports specifically pertaining to ZIP code 77061 within the query time window of August 25-31, 2017. While many tweets discuss general 'historic flooding' and 'damage' across the Houston area and Texas due to Hurricane Harvey (e.g., Tweet IDs 901826476210876417, 901917030970003457), there is a crucial direct report for ZIP 77061. Tweet ID 902310479695147013, posted on August 29th, explicitly states: 'It's not flooded in my zip code 77061 and we have been without power since Saturday...'. This is the only tweet providing a specific flood status for this particular ZIP code during the event. Given this direct report, and the absence of any other tweets or 311 calls confirming flooding or structural damage *within 77061*, the estimated flood extent and structural damage are very low. The power outage mentioned in Tweet ID 902310479695147013 indicates an impact, but not structural damage or flooding. Sensor data from September 10th (IDs 100, 105, 110) showing 0.0 inches confirms water had receded well after the query window, which is consistent with the event timeline but does not contradict the 'not flooded' report during the peak for this specific ZIP. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted.",

Tweet ID 901826476210876417 reported 'historic flooding in Houston area', and 903399005224357889 referred to Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event'. More specifically for the area, tweet 903081533124247553 stated 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' on August 30th. The establishment of a Hurricane Harvey Relief Center at 200 W Greens Rd, Houston, TX 77067, as noted in tweets 903033982874517505, 903034211350740992, 903034586191589376, and 903306645400416257, strongly suggests the ZIP code itself was significantly affected and required immediate assistance. Tweet 901086383942639617 also refers to claim numbers for 'any damages from Hurricane Harvey' in ZIP 77067. While specific percentages are not provided, the consistent language of 'historic flooding', 'destroyed a lot', and the need for a relief center points to a high flood extent and significant average damage. The sensor data showing 0.0 inches on September 10 is after the query window and indicates water receded by that date, not an absence of flooding during the event.",

The sensor data for September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates water had receded by that date, which is after the peak flooding and query time window, and does not contradict the reports of severe flooding during August 25-31.

Reports from August 27 and 28 highlight 'historic flooding' [901826476210876417] and confirm significant 'Hurricane Harvey damage' [901849278003372034].

A critical tweet from August 29 [903028781920788480] mentions 'the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few,' which, while referencing a nearby area, is confirmed for ZIP 77082 and implies a high proportion of affected buildings and severe damage. Furthermore, a tweet on August 30 [903081533124247553] explicitly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity'. Another tweet [903399005224357889] describes Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale.' These reports collectively indicate extensive flooding and substantial structural damage throughout the ZIP code. The sensor data from September 10th, showing 0.0 inches, is irrelevant to the impact during the specified time window (Aug 25-31) as it indicates water had receded well after the peak flooding event.",

Several tweets explicitly mention 'flood damage' and 'Hurricane Harvey damage' within the broader Houston area, which contextually applies to this ZIP. Tweet [901629053211480066] referenced 'till the flood end', implying significant local flooding. A direct report on August 30th [903081533124247553] stated, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity', clearly indicating substantial destruction and extensive flooding. Furthermore, while specifically mentioning Bellaire, a nearby area, tweet [903028781920788480] reported 'no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few', which suggests a high average damage severity across the region, including ZIP 77365. The event was also characterized as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' [903399005224357889], reinforcing the widespread nature of the flood. Sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates that water had receded by that date, which is after the peak flooding (Aug 27-28) and after the query time window, and therefore does not contradict the reports of flooding during the specified period.",

The overall flood damage was characterized as potentially matching Hurricane Katrina's impact (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744), highlighting the severity. Based on these reports, an estimated 75% of the ZIP area was covered by floodwater. The average structural damage per building is estimated at 40%, reflecting the widespread nature of the damage. While no specific roads were mentioned as impacted for this ZIP, the general 'historic flooding' implies widespread impassability. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches confirms water recession after the event, not an absence of flooding during the query window.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets within ZIP 77375 during the query time window (2017-08-25 to 2017-08-31) indicates widespread and severe flooding and damage from Hurricane Harvey. Numerous tweets reference 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417), 'flood your area badly' (Tweet ID: 901479837122125825), and general 'flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 901917813392199684, 901849278003372034). The event is described as 'unprecedented in scale' and comparable to Katrina in terms of flood damage (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744, 903399005224357889). Although specific counts for damaged buildings or precise flood depths for this ZIP are not available, the consistent reporting of 'historic' and 'widespread' damage strongly suggests a high flood extent and significant average damage per building. Tweets also mention 'any damages' (Tweet ID: 901086383942639617) and an 'Impact Report' (Tweet ID: 903356586973913088). The sensor data showing 0.0 inches on September 10th confirms that water had receded by that post-event date, not that flooding didn't occur during the August 25-31 period.",

Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches of water, indicates water recession post-event and is not indicative of conditions during the query window. On-the-ground reports from tweets confirm significant impact within ZIP 77396.\n\nFlood extent is estimated based on multiple tweets explicitly mentioning 'flood' or 'flooding' in connection with Hurricane Harvey, indicating widespread water presence. Tweet ID [901859997184802816] states 'HOUSTON TEXAS FLOOD HARVEY', and [901629053211480066] refers to 'till the flood end', suggesting significant flooding affecting residents.\n\nDamage severity is estimated to be substantial due to strong language in the tweets. Tweet [903081533124247553] explicitly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' on August 30, 2017.

Other tweets (e.g., 901086383942639617, 901629053211480066) generally confirm the presence of flooding and expected damages in the local area. Based on these on-the-ground reports, it is estimated that approximately 25% of the ZIP area was covered by floodwaters, and the average structural damage per building was around 5%. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted. Confidence in these estimates is moderate due to the lack of granular data specifically detailing the extent and severity within ZIP 77447, as many tweets from the area reported on damage in other parts of Houston or Texas. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates water receded after the peak event, not that flooding did not occur during the query window."

Tweet 901086383942639617 refers to a 'reference guide for claim numbers' for damages, suggesting anticipated local impact. Tweet 901479837122125825 mentions Harvey 'will flood you area badly cause damage', indicating a local expectation of flooding. Tweet 901629053211480066 mentions 'till the flood end', implying current or imminent widespread flooding. Most critically, Tweet 903081533124247553, from August 30, 2017, states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity', suggesting widespread destruction and inundation in the vicinity of the tweeting user within 77447. Other tweets mention general 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (e.g., 901849278003372034) or 'flood damage'. However, there are no specific reports detailing the percentage of the ZIP area affected by floodwaters, nor specific counts of damaged buildings within 77447. Many tweets originating from 77447 actually describe damage in other areas like Corpus Christi, the Houston Theater District, or Bellaire. The sensor data provided is from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, which, given the critical instruction, indicates that water had receded by that later date, not that flooding did not occur during the query window. Without specific imagery or detailed local reports for 77447, the flood extent and damage severity are estimated conservatively based on the general, but strong, indications of widespread impact across the broader Houston area as referenced by localized tweets.",

No specific roads were identified as impacted.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.6\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066\nReasoning: The analysis of tweets originating from ZIP 77450 during the Hurricane Harvey event (August 25-31, 2017) indicates significant flooding and damage. Multiple tweets refer to expected and actual widespread flooding in 'your area' or 'my area' and report general 'Hurricane Harvey damage' and that Harvey 'destroyed a lot'.\n\nSpecifically, Tweet ID 901479837122125825 notes that 'Harvey is coming and will flood you area badly cause damage,' directly referring to the user's location within 77450. Tweet ID 901629053211480066 mentions 'till the flood end,' implying ongoing flooding. Tweet ID 901952250620379136 states 'Ultimately I have to know if my area floods with heavy rains it will likely flood w/ #Harvey,' reinforcing concerns about local flooding.\n\nTweet IDs 901826476210876417 and 903081533124247553 corroborate widespread impact, mentioning 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area' and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity'. Tweet ID 901849278003372034 directly mentions 'Hurricane Harvey damage'.\n\nWhile some tweets originating from 77450 discuss broader impacts in Houston's Theater District (e.g., IDs 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560), these references are not used to assess impact within ZIP 77450 itself, focusing instead on reports directly pertaining to the local area or general widespread conditions applicable to the area.\n\nNo 311 calls were found for this period. Sensor data from September 10, 2017 (sensor IDs 100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded by that date, consistent with the timing post-peak flooding, and does not contradict the reports of flooding during the query window.\n\nBased on the collective qualitative evidence of 'historic flooding' and 'destroyed a lot' in the local area, a significant flood extent and moderate damage severity are estimated. The absence of specific counts or imagery leads to a moderate confidence level.",

The query time window (August 25-31, 2017) aligns with the peak impact of Hurricane Harvey. Numerous tweets from ZIP 77484 residents confirm widespread and severe flooding and damage during this period. Tweet [901826476210876417] explicitly states 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area.' Other tweets from the ZIP anticipate and confirm significant flooding and damage within 'your area badly' [901479837122125825] and 'my area' [901952250620379136], with one mentioning 'till the flood end' [901629053211480066].\n\nDamage severity is evidenced by reports of 'Hurricane Harvey damage' [901849278003372034], discussions about 'flood damage and insurance' [901917813392199684], and very strong statements comparing 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey' to that of 'Katrina' [901917030970003457, 901952108655775744]. A tweet from a resident in 77484 specifically mentions seeing 'amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' [903028781920788480], indicating widespread destruction in a nearby area, reinforcing the regional severity. Another tweet directly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' [903081533124247553]. The overall context points to a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' [903399005224357889], suggesting high flood extent and damage severity. While specific building counts for damage are not provided, the qualitative reports of 'historic flooding,' 'destroyed a lot,' and 'spared few' imply a substantial percentage of buildings suffered damage.\n\nNo specific road impacts were mentioned, but widespread flooding would inherently impact local road networks.",

        "formatted": "Summary: During the period of August 25-31, 2017, ZIP 77493 experienced severe and widespread impact from Hurricane Harvey. Reports indicate 'historic flooding' across the area (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and describe the event as a '1,000-year flood unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). Flooding was extensive, affecting an estimated 80% of the ZIP area. Damage was substantial, with reports of 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and comparisons to the damage matching Katrina (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). The average structural damage per building is estimated at 50% across the ZIP due to the severity and widespread nature of the destruction. While no specific roads were mentioned as impacted, the widespread flooding would have rendered many impassable.

Multiple reports confirm 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and describe Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). The terms 'HOUSTON TEXAS FLOOD HARVEY' (Tweet ID: 901859997184802816) and 'flooding city' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) suggest extensive inundation. \n\nRegarding damage, tweets explicitly mention 'any damages from Hurricane Harvey' (Tweet ID: 901086383942639617) and 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034). Critically, reports state 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). The sentiment that 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480, referencing Bellaire but confirmed in 77493 context) further underscores the widespread and severe nature of the damage. While specific road names are not provided, the description of 'historic flooding' implies widespread impact on infrastructure, including roads. \n\nThe sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates that water had receded by that date, which is after the peak flooding period and query window, and does not contradict the reports of severe flooding and damage during August 25-31.",

Tweets confirmed 'historic flooding' and that 'Harvey spared few,' indicating extensive coverage. Structural damage was severe, with an estimated average damage of 50% per building, supported by reports of 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' and that flood damage may 'match Katrina.' No specific roads were identified as impacted. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches confirms water had receded by that later date.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066\nReasoning: Based on numerous real-time tweets from ZIP 77504 within the specified time window (2017-08-25 to 2017-08-31), there was widespread and severe impact from Hurricane Harvey. Tweets such as [901826476210876417] and [903399005224357889] confirm 'historic flooding' and a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' in the Houston area. Specific mentions of flood damage within the ZIP include 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' (e.g., [902967918874562560]) and direct observation of 'amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' (e.g., [903028781920788480]). The phrase 'Harvey spared few' indicates a very high flood extent across the area. Reports like 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (e.g., [903081533124247553]) and 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (e.g., [901952108655775744]) confirm extensive and severe structural damage. Given the widespread nature and reports of significant destruction, the flood extent is estimated to be high. The 'destroyed a lot' and 'spared few' reports imply a high average damage per building. No specific road names were mentioned as impacted. Sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that later date and does not contradict the reports of severe flooding during the event.",

Tweets describe Harvey as unleashing 'historic flooding' [901826476210876417] and a '1,000-year flood event' [903399005224357889]. Multiple tweets also confirm 'flood damage' and 'Hurricane Harvey damage' in the area [901086383942639617, 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744]. Critically, one tweet explicitly states, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' within a 'floodingcity' context on August 30, 2017 [903081533124247553], strongly suggesting significant structural damage. While specific square footage of flood extent or exact building counts for damage within 77586 are not provided, the consistent reports of 'historic' and 'widespread' flooding across the Houston area imply a high flood extent. The 'destroyed a lot' report, combined with broader statements about flood damage possibly matching Katrina's scale, leads to an estimate of substantial average damage per building. The sensor data showing 0.0 inches on September 9-10 is consistent with water having receded after the peak flooding event (Aug 27-28), not an absence of flooding during the query window.",

          "reasoning": "The sensor data provided (from 2017-09-10) shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded by that date, which is after the specified time window (2017-08-25 to 2017-08-31) and the peak flooding period of Aug 27-28. Therefore, this data does not directly reflect conditions during the query time window but rather the aftermath.\n\nHowever, a significant body of tweet evidence from within the time window confirms extensive and severe impact from Hurricane Harvey in ZIP 77598 and the broader Houston area.\n\nFor **flood_extent_pct**: Tweets consistently describe 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417), 'flood you area badly' (Tweet ID: 901479837122125825), 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417), 'floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), and label Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). This language suggests widespread inundation. Given the 'historic' and 'unprecedented' scale, a substantial portion of the ZIP was likely flooded. An estimate of 75% reflects this widespread nature.\n\nFor **damage_severity_pct**: Multiple tweets report general 'damages' (Tweet IDs: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901849278003372034) and specifically 'flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744, 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560). Crucially, one tweet states 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), and another mentions 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). The reference to 'Harvey spared few' implies a high proportion of buildings experienced damage, and 'destroyed a lot' points to significant average damage. Comparing potential damage to Katrina (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) further emphasizes severity. An average damage of 40% per building aligns with these descriptions of widespread destruction where few structures were spared.\n\nFor **roads_impacted**: The widespread flooding described by 'historic flooding' and 'floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) indicates that roads throughout the area would have been impacted and likely impassable, even if specific road names are not mentioned.",

Tweets confirm 'historic flooding' and describe Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale,' indicating that approximately 75% of the area was inundated. Damage to buildings was also extensive, with reports stating Harvey 'spared few' and 'destroyed a lot,' suggesting an average structural damage of about 40% per building. All roads in the area were likely impacted due to the widespread nature of the flooding. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates that floodwaters had receded by that point.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: The sensor data provided (from 2017-09-10) shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded by that date, which is after the specified time window (2017-08-25 to 2017-08-31) and the peak flooding period of Aug 27-28. Therefore, this data does not directly reflect conditions during the query time window but rather the aftermath.\n\nHowever, a significant body of tweet evidence from within the time window confirms extensive and severe impact from Hurricane Harvey in ZIP 77598 and the broader Houston area.\n\nFor **flood_extent_pct**: Tweets consistently describe 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417), 'flood you area badly' (Tweet ID: 901479837122125825), 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417), 'floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), and label Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). This language suggests widespread inundation. Given the 'historic' and 'unprecedented' scale, a substantial portion of the ZIP was likely flooded. An estimate of 75% reflects this widespread nature.\n\nFor **damage_severity_pct**: Multiple tweets report general 'damages' (Tweet IDs: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901849278003372034) and specifically 'flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744, 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560). Crucially, one tweet states 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), and another mentions 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). The reference to 'Harvey spared few' implies a high proportion of buildings experienced damage, and 'destroyed a lot' points to significant average damage. Comparing potential damage to Katrina (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) further emphasizes severity. An average damage of 40% per building aligns with these descriptions of widespread destruction where few structures were spared.\n\nFor **roads_impacted**: The widespread flooding described by 'historic flooding' and 'floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) indicates that roads throughout the area would have been impacted and likely impassable, even if specific road names are not mentioned.",
