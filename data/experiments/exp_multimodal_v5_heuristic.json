A report from Tweet [902711251444400133] explicitly states 'WATER IS CHEST LEVEL' at 9722 Aguila Dr, indicating high flood depths within the ZIP. Multiple tweets, including [903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], and [903992796763348992], assert that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones,' suggesting a significant flood extent across the area. The general sentiment across tweets like [902835549135917056] ('historic flooding') and [903399005224357889] ('1,000-year flood event') reinforces the scale of the disaster.\n\nDamage severity is supported by the 'chest level' water report, which typically leads to substantial structural damage. Other tweets mentioning 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' ([902889458860785664], [902933605168685056], [902946518239387648], [902967918874562560]), 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' ([903081533124247553]), and 'The damage from Harvey is unbelievable' ([903656280010711042]) indicate a high level of structural impact. Tweet [903028781920788480], while mentioning Bellaire, states 'Harvey spared few,' implying widespread severe damage in affected regions.\n\nNo 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the specified time window were available for corroboration. No imagery was provided. The lack of additional data streams slightly limits the confidence, but the detailed on-the-ground reports from tweets provide strong evidence for the estimates. | Visual evidence: Widespread evidence of past flooding with debris and sediment deposits.; Significant structural damage in some areas, especially roof damage. | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=60%, Visual=100% \u2192 Used visual_confirms_strong\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.82\nCited Tweets: 902711251444400133, 902835549135917056, 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648\nReasoning: Text evidence: Analysis of geo-located tweets for ZIP 77013 reveals widespread and severe flooding and structural damage.
