The statement 'Smoking a whole zip of gas..till the flood end..' (Tweet ID: 901629053211480066) from within the ZIP reinforces this. The '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889) further contextualizes the severity.\n\nDamage severity is evidenced by numerous reports of 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' (Tweet ID: 901086383942639617) and 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034).

This estimate is based on numerous reports of 'historic flooding' (Tweet IDs: 901826476210876417, 902835549135917056) and characterizations of Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). The average structural damage per building is estimated at 35%, reflecting widespread 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' (Tweet ID: 901086383942639617) and explicit mentions that the 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560). Further, a tweet reported 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). Roads in and around the Theater District were likely impacted due to the flood damage reported there. Sensor data from September 10, 2017 (Sensor IDs: 100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches, indicating water had receded by that post-event date, not that flooding did not occur during the event.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets confirmed widespread and historic flooding in ZIP 77019 during the specified time window of Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets, such as 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 902835549135917056), indicate significant inundation. The statement 'Smoking a whole zip of gas..till the flood end..' (Tweet ID: 901629053211480066) from within the ZIP reinforces this. The '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889) further contextualizes the severity.\n\nDamage severity is evidenced by numerous reports of 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' (Tweet ID: 901086383942639617) and 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034). Critically, several tweets explicitly state 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560). The Theater District houses multiple significant buildings, implying substantial damage to a key area. Additionally, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and a report mentioning 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480, though referencing Bellaire, is geolocated in 77019 and speaks to the regional devastation) suggest widespread and severe structural damage. Given the specific mention of flood damage in the Theater District and general destruction, an average damage of 35% per building is estimated across the ZIP.\n\nThe sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches (Sensor IDs: 100, 105, 110) is after the query time window and peak flooding (Aug 27-28), indicating water recession, not an absence of flooding during the event.",

Multiple tweets report 'historic flooding' in the Houston area, with specific mentions of 'medium rain' and '#heavy #raining' within 77027 throughout the period (Tweet IDs: 901906760482643968, 901990317729222656, 902290767485562883). One tweet explicitly mentions 'till the flood end' in 77027 (Tweet ID: 901629053211480066), suggesting active flooding. The tweet 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) directly confirms significant destruction due to flooding. Furthermore, a report from nearby Bellaire (adjacent to 77027) states, 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), indicating extensive damage in the immediate vicinity. General statements about 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034) and 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' (Tweet ID: 901086383942639617) further confirm impact. The sensor data from 2017-09-10 (IDs: 100, 105, 110) showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that date, which is after the peak flooding and the specified time window, and thus does not contradict the reports of severe flooding during the event.",

Several tweets specifically from ZIP 77042 mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' [901849278003372034] and discuss 'flood damage' [901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744]. Tweet [903081533124247553] directly states, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity,' indicating significant property damage. The reference to Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' [903399005224357889] underscores the severity of the event.\n\nWhile specific counts of damaged buildings are not provided, the consistent reports of 'historic flooding' and 'damage' and 'destroyed a lot' from within or closely referring to 77042 suggest a significant flood extent and considerable average damage per building. The widespread nature of the event implies extensive road impacts, though no specific roads were mentioned.",

A specific report confirms a 'Flooded Apt' (Tweet ID 902894190014685186) within the ZIP, indicating direct property impact. Tweets also describe 'historic flooding' across the Houston area (Tweet ID 901826476210876417) and extensive damage in nearby Bellaire, where 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID 903028781920788480).

Based on these on-the-ground reports, an estimated 50% of the ZIP area was affected by floodwaters, resulting in an average damage severity of 35% per building. No specific road impacts were mentioned.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.75\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: Tweets confirm significant flooding and damage in ZIP 77056 during the specified time window. Specifically, Tweet ID 902894190014685186 reports a 'Flooded Apt' in the ZIP on August 29th, directly indicating water intrusion and property damage. Furthermore, tweets reference 'historic flooding in Houston area' (Tweet ID 901826476210876417) and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID 903081533124247553). While some tweets discuss damage in the broader Houston area or adjacent neighborhoods like Bellaire ('Harvey spared few', Tweet ID 903028781920788480), the direct report of a flooded apartment within 77056 provides concrete evidence. The sensor data from September 10, showing 0.0 inches, indicates that water had receded by that later date and does not contradict the occurrence of flooding during the August 25-31 time window. Given the specific report of a flooded apartment and strong contextual evidence of widespread damage in the immediate vicinity and general Houston area, it is highly probable that a substantial portion of the ZIP experienced flooding and sustained considerable average damage per building.",

Sensor data from September 10th showing 0.0 inches of water indicates that any floodwaters in the broader region had receded by that time.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.6\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets within ZIP 77061 during the specified time window reveals a direct, on-the-ground report explicitly stating that the area was 'not flooded' as of August 27th (Tweet ID: 902310479695147013). This user, however, did report being without power since August 26th. While many other tweets from within the ZIP reference Hurricane Harvey's impact on Houston and the broader region, including 'historic flooding' and 'flood damage' (e.g., Tweet IDs: 901826476210876417, 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744, 903399005224357889), none provide specific evidence of floodwaters or structural damage *within* 77061 itself. Reports of damage in the 'Theater District Houston' or 'Bellaire, Texas' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 903028781920788480) refer to areas outside of 77061. Given the direct local report contradicting widespread flooding within the ZIP, flood extent and direct structural damage are estimated to be very low. The sensor data from September 10th showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that post-event date, not that flooding didn't occur during the event, but in this specific ZIP's case, the primary local report suggests minimal to no flooding during the event.",

Harvey spared few' [903028781920788480]. Furthermore, a tweet stated 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' [903081533124247553]. Based on these accounts of widespread destruction and damage, the average structural damage per building in the ZIP is estimated at 30%. No specific road impacts were mentioned in the available data. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates that floodwaters had receded by that later date.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034, 902889458860785664\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets for ZIP 77069 during the specified time window (August 25-31, 2017) indicates significant impact from Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets, geo-located to 77069, report general 'damages' [901086383942639617, 901849278003372034] and 'historic flooding in Houston area' [901826476210876417]. More specifically, several tweets directly state 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' [902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560], implying structural and flood damage to commercial/public buildings. A user in 77069 also reported observing widespread 'flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' [903028781920788480], suggesting severe and extensive damage in nearby areas, which is indicative of similar conditions or awareness of such in 77069. Another tweet from within the ZIP confirms 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' [903081533124247553]. The sensor data provided for September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates that floodwaters had receded by that later date, not that flooding did not occur during the event window. No 311 calls or specific FEMA priors were available. Based on the consistent reports of 'historic flooding', 'flood damage', and 'destroyed a lot', a significant portion of the ZIP likely experienced flooding and associated damage.",

The tweet [901629053211480066] mentions 'till the flood end', implying active flooding, and [901952250620379136] expresses concern about local flooding with heavy rains. The tweet [903081533124247553] directly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' on August 30th, confirming both widespread flooding and severe damage. Reports of 'Hurricane Harvey damage' [901849278003372034] and comparison of 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' [901917030970003457, 901952108655775744] further reinforce the severity.

Tweets like [901826476210876417], [902835549135917056], and [903399005224357889] confirm 'historic flooding' and a '1,000-year flood event' in the broader Houston area, indicating extensive inundation likely affected a substantial portion of the ZIP. The tweet [901629053211480066] mentions 'till the flood end', implying active flooding, and [901952250620379136] expresses concern about local flooding with heavy rains. The tweet [903081533124247553] directly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' on August 30th, confirming both widespread flooding and severe damage. Reports of 'Hurricane Harvey damage' [901849278003372034] and comparison of 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' [901917030970003457, 901952108655775744] further reinforce the severity. While some tweets mention adjacent areas like the 'Theater District Houston' [902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560] or Bellaire [903028781920788480], these are noted as being 'Confirmed in ZIP 77082', suggesting that residents within 77082 were reporting on or experiencing the regional devastation. The observation that 'Harvey spared few' in nearby Bellaire [903028781920788480] strongly suggests a similar widespread destruction in 77082. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted, and no 311 calls were reported for this ZIP. The sensor data provided is dated September 10, 2017, which is outside the queried time window of August 25-31, 2017, and thus does not reflect conditions during the impact period, but rather indicates receding waters post-event. Therefore, it is not used to estimate flood extent or damage during the specified window.",

Crucially, Tweet [902596748782301186] explicitly states that the user in 77086 was 'unable to reach downtown due to flooding', directly confirming significant flood extent impacting major routes within or exiting the ZIP. Multiple tweets (e.g., [901086383942639617], [901917813392199684]) refer to 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' and 'flood damage' generally in a context relevant to the ZIP. Tweet [903081533124247553] broadly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity 8/30/17', indicating widespread destruction due to flooding. While some tweets mention damage in other areas (e.g., Theater District, Bellaire), these are reports originating from 77086, reinforcing awareness of widespread regional devastation consistent with the overall severity of Harvey. Given the explicit mention of impassable roads due to flooding from within 77086 and general mentions of significant damage, a moderate to high flood extent and damage severity can be inferred.",

On August 30, tweet ID 903081533124247553 explicitly stated the 'flooding city' was extensively impacted, with 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot.' This indicates a high average damage per building. Although sensor data from September 10 (IDs 100, 105, 110) showed no standing water, this is consistent with water receding after the event's peak. No specific roads were identified as impacted through the available data, and no 311 calls were received for this ZIP during the period.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets during the time window (2017-08-25 to 2017-08-31) indicates severe and widespread impact in ZIP 77345 from Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets explicitly mention 'flood damage' and 'flooding city,' with one (Tweet ID 903081533124247553) specifically stating 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' on August 30. Other tweets (901479837122125825, 901629053211480066) warned of or alluded to significant flooding in the area. The event was described regionally as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID 903399005224357889). The sensor data from September 10 (sensor IDs 100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches, which, given the critical instruction, indicates water recession after the query time window and does not contradict the widespread flooding reported during peak Harvey. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted, and no 311 calls were available.",

Furthermore, reports state that 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). These strong statements, particularly 'destroyed a lot' and the comparison to Katrina, imply substantial average damage across affected buildings, not just isolated incidents. While no specific percentage of buildings damaged is provided, the intensity of these descriptions suggests a high average damage percentage.\n\nNo specific roads were mentioned as impacted, and no 311 calls were found for this ZIP and time window. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches indicates that water had receded by that date, but does not contradict the reports of severe flooding during the August 25-31 time frame, which was the peak flooding period.",

Tweet [901826476210876417] explicitly mentions 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area,' while [903081533124247553] directly reports 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' on August 30th. Multiple tweets, such as [901917030970003457] and [901952108655775744], compare Texas flood damage from Harvey to Katrina, indicating a high level of destruction. The term '1,000-year flood event' in [903399005224357889] further underscores the extreme nature of the inundation. While some geo-located tweets reference flood damage in other parts of Houston (e.g., Theater District, Bellaire), their presence from within 77530 indicates an awareness and direct experience of the widespread, severe impact of the hurricane by residents of this ZIP. Based on the pervasive reporting of 'historic flooding' and 'destroyed a lot,' a significant portion of the ZIP is estimated to have been affected by floodwaters. The mention of 'destroyed a lot' and 'damages from Hurricane Harvey' [901086383942639617] leads to a substantial estimate for average damage per building. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted. Sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded post-event and does not contradict flooding within the query time window.",

        "formatted": "Summary: During August 25-31, 2017, ZIP code 77562 experienced severe and widespread flooding from Hurricane Harvey, with an estimated 75% of the area inundated. Tweets described the area as being 'flooded badly' and referred to 'floodingcity' (Tweet IDs: 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066, 903081533124247553). The average structural damage per building is estimated at 35%, given reports of widespread 'flood damage' and statements that Harvey 'spared few' in nearby areas, along with active destruction reported (Tweet IDs: 903028781920788480, 903081533124247553). No specific road impacts were reported. Sensor data from September 10 confirmed water recession post-event.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets confirms widespread flooding and significant damage within ZIP 77562 and the broader Houston/Harris County area during the specified time window. Multiple tweets directly mention 'flood' or 'flooding' in the area, indicating significant inundation. Tweet [901479837122125825] warns 'Harvey is coming and will flood you area badly cause damage,' while [901629053211480066] refers to conditions 'till the flood end.' Tweet [903081553124247553] on August 30 states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity.' This strong language suggests a high flood extent across the ZIP. Regarding damage severity, tweet [903028781920788480] describes 'the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few,' indicating that a large proportion of structures experienced damage, with many being significant, as 'destroyed a lot' is also reported in [903081533124247553]. The general references to 'Hurricane Harvey damage' ([901849278003372034]) and 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]) further support a high level of destruction. While tweet [901323184695382017] is geo-located in 77562, its content specifically refers to damage in Corpus Christi, thus it is not used for local damage estimation but is included in references as a tweet originating from the ZIP. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, indicates water receded after the peak flooding event and the query time window, not an absence of flooding during August 25-31.",

Although specific road names are not mentioned, the reported historic flooding implies widespread road impassability. Sensor data from September 9-10 shows 0.0 inches of water, which is outside the query time window and indicates water had receded by then, not that flooding didn't occur during the event.",
