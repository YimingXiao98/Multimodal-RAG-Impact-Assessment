Multiple reports describe 'historic flooding' (Tweet IDs: 901826476210876417, 902835549135917056) and significant 'flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744, 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560).

The event is characterized as a '1,000-year flood' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889), with flood damage potentially matching Katrina (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). While specific localized flood extent or structural damage percentages for 77088 are not provided, the collective sentiment of widespread and severe destruction across the region strongly indicates high impact within the ZIP code. No 311 calls or relevant sensor data were available for this period to refine these estimates further, but the consistent tweet reports provide a strong basis.",

Specific areas like Fondren and Bissonnet experienced flood damage, as noted in Tweet ID 904837837140484096. Multiple tweets, including IDs 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, and 906480493083983872, consistently reported 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage,' indicating substantial property impact. Flood damage assessments were also underway as reported in Tweet ID 905820640015511552. The cumulative evidence suggests a moderate flood extent affecting a notable percentage of the ZIP area and a considerable average structural damage severity for affected properties. There were no 311 calls found for this location and time period.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.65\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: While sensor data for the last day of the time window (2017-09-10) shows 0.0 inches of rainfall, numerous real-time reports from Tweets confirm significant flooding and damage in ZIP 77048 during the specified period. Tweets reference 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston' (904837837140484096), indicating localized but impactful flooding. Multiple tweets explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (e.g., 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872), 'Harvey flooding impact on insurance' (905152576756137984), 'flood damage assessments in progress' (905820640015511552), and the 'extent of Harvey damage' (905435273726746624, 905450598950109185), suggesting widespread structural and property damage. The prevalence of these reports, despite the absence of 311 calls or specific quantitative flood extent data, points to substantial impact. The mention of 'Fondren and Bissonnet area' directly identifies two impacted roads.",

There were no 311 calls or relevant sensor data for this period, but the consistent on-the-ground reports from tweets provide high confidence in these estimates.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.85\nCited Tweets: 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684\nReasoning: Analysis of real-time Twitter reports for ZIP 77642 indicates extensive and severe flooding during the specified time window. Multiple tweets describe 'historic flooding' (Tweet 901826476210876417) and confirm 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweets 903823717926567936, 903992796763348992), suggesting a very high percentage of the area was inundated. The event is characterized as a '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet 903399005224357889). Structural damage is repeatedly mentioned as severe, with reports of 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet 903081533124247553), 'unbelievable' damage (Tweet 903656280010711042), and 'Harvey spared few' in areas like Bellaire (Tweet 903028781920788480). The Theater District Houston is specifically cited as suffering 'flood damage' (Tweets 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560). No 311 calls were reported, and sensor data provided is outside the relevant time window, but the volume and consistency of tweet reports provide strong evidence for these estimates.",
