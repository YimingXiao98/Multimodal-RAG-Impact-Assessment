The Theater District was reported to have suffered flood damage (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560), and a rescue was conducted on 10210 CE King Pkwy due to flooding (Tweet ID: 902680538586238981). Reports indicated that 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and caused 'unbelievable' damage (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042), with water damage extending significantly beyond typical flood zones (Tweet IDs: 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992).

The Harris County Appraisal District also launched a 'Damage Report Feature' (Tweet ID 905524226022674436) and surveys for damaged homes (Tweet ID 906567125384364032), further confirming the existence of significant damage. Sensor data for the end of the period (Sensor IDs 100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches of rainfall, suggesting no new precipitation or active widespread flooding during this specific time, implying that the mentioned 'flood damage' refers to the aftermath of the initial Hurricane Harvey event rather than ongoing inundation. No 311 calls or specific reports of road impacts were found. The estimates for flood extent and damage severity are inferred from the general nature of these reports.",

Multiple tweets refer to 'historic flooding' ([901826476210876417], [902835549135917056]), with one resident expressing concern that 'my area floods with heavy rains it will likely flood w/ #Harvey' ([901952250620379136]). The general impact is described as a 'floodingcity' ([903081533124247553]) and a '1,000-year flood event' ([903399005224357889]).\n\nRegarding damage severity, tweets explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' ([901849278003372034]) and that 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' ([903081533124247553]). The damage was deemed 'unbelievable' ([903656280010711042]) and comparisons were made to Katrina's scale of damage by an insurance group ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]).

A tweet originating from 77035 describing damage in nearby Bellaire stated 'Harvey spared few' ([903028781920788480]), suggesting widespread and comprehensive damage in the region.\n\nNo specific roads were mentioned as impacted, but the general description of widespread flooding implies significant disruption to road networks.

While broader tweets referenced widespread 'historic flooding' and extensive 'water damage' across Houston, the direct report from AGUILA DR provides concrete evidence for the severe impact within this ZIP code.

Specifically, Tweet [902711251444400133] reports 'chest level' water inside a house at 9722 AGUILA DR, requiring the rescue of two seniors in wheelchairs.

While no 311 calls were received for this ZIP code, the consistent and high volume of damage reports from tweets points to a moderate-to-high flood extent affecting approximately 50% of the area, leading to an average damage severity of about 40% for affected structures. Sensor data from the end of the period (September 10th) showed no active rainfall, suggesting floodwaters had receded.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.75\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: The analysis of provided tweets indicates significant post-Hurricane Harvey impact in ZIP code 77048. Multiple tweets refer to 'flood damage assessment' and 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' or 'Home Damage'. Specifically, tweet [904837837140484096] mentions 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment', confirming localized yet substantial flooding. Other tweets like [905160043183693824], [905430986497945600], [905920666096078848], and [906480493083983872] consistently report 'House Damage' or 'Home Damage'. Tweet [906567125384364032] shows Harris County asking residents to complete surveys for home damage, implying widespread structural impact. The Harris County Appraisal District also launched a 'Damage Report Feature' (Tweet ID 905524226022674436), further solidifying the need for damage reporting and assessment. While specific quantitative data (e.g., precise flood depths or number of affected properties) is absent, the consistent qualitative reports point to considerable flood extent and structural damage. No 311 calls were reported for this ZIP code during the time window. Sensor data from 2017-09-10 shows 0.0 inches, indicating floodwaters had receded by the end of the period, but does not reflect conditions during the peak impact.",

The damage is described as 'unbelievable' ([903656280010711042]). The mention of calls to 'FILE A CLAIM NOW!!' for affected homes ([903112917180178432]) further supports widespread residential impact. A death toll in Texas attributed to the flood also indicates severe impact ([902388226442264576]).

Multiple tweets refer to 'historic flooding' ([902835549135917056], [903399005224357889]), with one specifically calling it a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' ([903399005224357889]). Crucially, several reports state that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' ([903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], [903992796763348992]), suggesting a very high percentage of the area was inundated. \n\nRegarding damage severity, tweets consistently report 'flood damage' to key areas like the 'Theater District Houston' ([902889458860785664], [902933605168685056], [902946518239387648], [902967918874562560]). Personal accounts describe 'no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' ([903028781920788480]), and that Hurricane Harvey 'destroyed a lot' ([903081533124264576, assuming a typo in the provided data 903081533124247553 is the correct ID based on the text]). The damage is described as 'unbelievable' ([903656280010711042]). The mention of calls to 'FILE A CLAIM NOW!!' for affected homes ([903112917180178432]) further supports widespread residential impact. A death toll in Texas attributed to the flood also indicates severe impact ([902388226442264576]). While specific roads are not mentioned, the pervasive nature of the flooding implies significant disruption to transportation networks.\n\nNo 311 calls were found for this ZIP code within the time window.

Tweets also refer to 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (904487470984830976, 905920666096078848) and the need for 'Harvey Flood Help' (903989728726454273), suggesting notable structural damage to properties. One tweet (905820640015511552) confirms that 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress' and advises reporting damage to 311, reinforcing the presence of damage needing assessment. No specific road impacts were reported, and no 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the time window were available to provide more localized or precise measurements.",
