Multiple tweets reference 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (Tweet IDs: 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872), suggesting direct structural impact. The 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston' (Tweet ID: 904837837140484096) points to specific localized impact on roads and surrounding properties. Furthermore, the mention of 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress' (Tweet ID: 905820640015511552) and the 'Harris County Appraisal District App' featuring a 'Hurricane Harvey Damage Report Feature' (Tweet ID: 905524226022674436) strongly imply that damage was extensive enough to warrant official assessment and reporting across the county, including this ZIP code. While no 311 calls or specific flood depths from sensors were provided for this ZIP, the consistent reports of damage from social media indicate significant consequences. The sensor data at the end of the window showing 0.0 in rainfall does not preclude prior flooding during the event.",

Tweet ID [901826476210876417] explicitly states \"Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area,\" which is reinforced by [902835549135917056] mentioning \"historic flooding\" and [903399005224357889] describing it as a \"1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale.\" The extent of flooding is also suggested by the term \"#floodingcity\" in [903081533124247553]. Regarding damage, tweets indicate severe structural impact. [901849278003372034] mentions \"Hurricane Harvey damage,\" while [903081533124247553] states \"Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot.\" The potential scale of damage is highlighted by comparisons to Katrina's impact on flood damage ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]). Furthermore, tweet [903656280010711042] describes the damage as \"unbelievable.\" There were no 311 calls for this ZIP code during the specified time window.

Multiple tweets describe 'historic flooding' and refer to Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event' ([901826476210876417], [903399005224357889]). Reports mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' ([901849278003372034]) and that the storm 'destroyed a lot' with 'flood damage' widespread ([903081533124247553]). One tweet directly states, 'Harvey spared few' in reference to flood damage in Bellaire, a neighboring area, strongly implying similar conditions in 77025 ([903028781920788480]). Comparisons to Katrina's flood damage potential also suggest high severity ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]). Additionally, power outages were reported in the 77025 zip code, specifically at 4134 Woodfin St ([901916864099516416], [901920412006838272]). The absence of 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the time window means the estimates rely solely on the on-the-ground social media reports.",

Tweets describe 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 902835549135917056) and characterize Hurricane Harvey as an 'unprecedented' '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). Crucially, reports explicitly state that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (Tweet IDs: 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992), indicating a very broad flood extent across the area. The severity of damage is highlighted by repeated mentions of the 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560). A particularly strong indicator of high severity is a tweet expressing 'no words for the amount of flood damage' and stating that 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), along with direct statements like 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and 'The damage from Harvey is unbelievable' (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042).

Tweet 904837837140484096 specifically mentioned a flood damage assessment in the Fondren and Bissonnet area. Reports of \"Hurricane Harvey House Damage\" were prevalent (Tweets 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872), suggesting moderate to significant structural damage.

Tweet 904837837140484096 specifically mentions a \"flood damage assessment\" in the \"Fondren and Bissonnet area,\" indicating both flooding and damage in a specific part of the ZIP, potentially impacting major roads.

Residents in the ZIP were also identified as being impacted by Harvey flooding (Tweet 905336770635685888). While sensor data for the end of the period shows no active rainfall, it does not preclude prior flooding or ongoing damage assessment from earlier events.

Tweet 905820640015511552 notes that 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress', further confirming the ongoing impact evaluation. Tweet 906567125384364032 encourages residents with damaged homes to fill out a survey. While no 311 calls were reported for this period, and sensor data shows 0.0 inches of rainfall on September 10th (indicating the immediate rainfall event had passed), the consistent reporting of damage and assessment activities strongly indicates that a significant portion of the ZIP experienced flooding and sustained moderate structural damage from the preceding storm.

Tweets from September 4th to September 7th consistently mention damage, flood impact, and ongoing damage assessments. For example, Tweet 904837837140484096 explicitly refers to 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston'. Numerous other tweets (905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872) report 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' or 'Home Damage'. Tweet 905820640015511552 notes that 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress', further confirming the ongoing impact evaluation. Tweet 906567125384364032 encourages residents with damaged homes to fill out a survey. While no 311 calls were reported for this period, and sensor data shows 0.0 inches of rainfall on September 10th (indicating the immediate rainfall event had passed), the consistent reporting of damage and assessment activities strongly indicates that a significant portion of the ZIP experienced flooding and sustained moderate structural damage from the preceding storm. The specific extent of flooding or the average depth is not quantifiable from the provided data, but the widespread nature of damage reports suggests a notable impact across residential areas. No specific roads were identified as impacted or closed.",

There were no specific reports of road impacts or 311 calls from this ZIP code during the specified time.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.65\nCited Tweets: 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417\nReasoning: The analysis relies heavily on social media reports as there is no 311 call data, no relevant sensor data within the timeframe, and no FEMA prior specific to this ZIP code. Tweets originating from ZIP 77486 indicate that residents were bracing for significant impact from Hurricane Harvey [901377628594196481, 901377762476392449]. Subsequent tweets confirm that the \"Houston area\" experienced \"historic flooding\" [901826476210876417, 901859997184802816, 903399005224357889], and there was an expectation that the \"area badly cause damage\" [901479837122125825]. A direct report from within the ZIP states \"Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity 8/30/17 Wednesday @\u2026\" [903081533124247553], strongly suggesting widespread flooding and significant structural damage within the ZIP code.

The financial impact was regionally compared to Katrina, indicating severe widespread damage [901917030970003457, 901952108655775744]. While some tweets originating from 77486 referred to impacts in other specific Houston areas like the Theater District or Bellaire, the aggregate sentiment and specific local reports (e.g., \"floodingcity\", \"destroyed a lot\") point to substantial local impact within 77486. No specific road closures were reported. Sensor data provided is outside the specified time window and therefore not relevant to estimating impact during the event.",

A tweet from Bellaire (a nearby community) notes the extent of 'flood damage' and states that 'Harvey spared few', suggesting widespread structural impact. Another tweet mentions Harvey 'destroyed a lot'. The phrasing 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' further supports extensive flooding.

Reports of the 'Death Toll On Hurricane Harvey Flood Hits 8 In Texas' (Tweet ID: 902388226442264576) suggest severe life-threatening conditions. Phrases like 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), 'unbelievable damage' (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042), and 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480) point to high structural damage severity and a broad flood extent, including areas 'far beyond flood zones' (Tweet ID: 903823717926567936). The absence of relevant 311 calls or impactful sensor data means the estimates rely solely on the social media reports.",

Multiple tweets, although confirmed in ZIP 77546 (Santa Fe, Galveston County), explicitly refer to flooding and damage in Harris County locations like Houston and Bellaire. Early tweets indicated that 'Houston braces for impact from Hurricane Harvey' ([901377628594196481], [901377762476392449]). By August 27-28, reports escalated, stating 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area' ([901826476210876417]) and 'HOUSTON TEXAS FLOOD HARVEY' ([901859997184802816]). The widespread nature of the disaster is emphasized by comparisons, 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]), and descriptions of the event as 'a 1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' ([903399005224357889]). Specific areas mentioned include 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' ([902889458860785664], [902933605168685056], [902967918874562560]) and significant damage in Bellaire, Texas, where 'Harvey spared few' ([903028781920788480]). General mentions of 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' ([903081533124247553]) further indicate severe impact. There is one tweet ([901323184695382017]) that mentions Corpus Christi, which is not relevant to Harris County for this assessment.
