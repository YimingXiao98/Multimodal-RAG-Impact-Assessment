The statement 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., [903823717926567936]) indicates a large flood extent across the ZIP. Specific structural damage is reported for the 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' (e.g., [902889458860785664]), which is contextually attributed to ZIP 77022 by the provided tweet list. General severe damage is also noted with phrases like 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' [903081533124247553] and 'The damage from Harvey is unbelievable' [903656280010711042].

Several tweets indicate 'historic flooding' ([901826476210876417]) and that Hurricane Harvey 'destroyed a lot' ([903081533124247553]), describing the event as 'unprecedented in scale' ([903399005224357889]). While some specific damage reports refer to other Houston-area locations like the Theater District or Bellaire, their origin from ZIP 77546 implies local awareness and experience of the widespread devastation. The mention of a 'reference guide for claim numbers' ([901086383942639617]) also suggests that residents in 77546 were anticipating or experiencing damage requiring insurance claims. Given the strong language regarding 'historic flooding' and 'destroyed a lot', a significant portion of the area likely experienced flood inundation and substantial structural damage.

The Theater District in Houston, located within this ZIP, also suffered flood damage (e.g., Tweet ID 902889458860785664). Based on these reports, an estimated 75% of the ZIP area was impacted by floodwaters, and the average structural damage per building is estimated at 65% due to the widespread and destructive nature of the flooding. No specific road impacts were mentioned in the provided reports.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.75\nCited Tweets: 901629053211480066, 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744\nReasoning: Analysis of the provided tweets for ZIP 77521 during the specified time window indicates widespread and severe flooding, leading to significant structural damage. Multiple reports highlight extensive 'flood damage' and 'water damage' across the area, including the Theater District. The sentiment 'Harvey spared few' in Tweet ID 903028781920788480 and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' in Tweet ID 903081533124247553 suggests a high average damage across buildings. The repeated mention that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet ID 903823717926567936) points to a broad flood extent, impacting a large percentage of the ZIP area. The overall scale of the event is described as 'unprecedented' and a '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID 903399005224357889), reinforcing the widespread nature of the impact. There were no 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the specified time window to provide additional context, nor was imagery provided. No specific reports of road impacts were available.",

Damage reports consistently mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet 901849278003372034), 'flood damage' (Tweets 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744, 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560), and explicitly state 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet 903081533124247553) and 'unbelievable damage' (Tweet 903656280010711042). The phrase 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet 903028781920788480) further reinforces the idea of widespread and significant structural damage across many buildings. There were no 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the specified time frame to further refine these estimates. No specific roads were named as impacted within the ZIP code.",
