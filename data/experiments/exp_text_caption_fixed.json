Without specific counts of damaged buildings or precise area measurements, estimating average damage per building and flood extent relies on the consistent qualitative reports of damage.

However, multiple tweets (e.g., IDs 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600) reported 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage,' and Harris County explicitly requested residents to report 'flood damage' and 'home damage' through official channels (e.g., IDs 905524226022674436, 906567125384364032).

No specific roads were identified as impacted. Confidence in these estimates is moderate due to the lack of specific quantitative data from on-the-ground reports.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.6\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: The time window from September 4th to September 10th, 2017, falls within the post-Hurricane Harvey damage assessment and recovery phase for Harris County. Sensor data recorded on September 10th showed 0.0 inches of water across multiple sensors (IDs 100, 105, 110), indicating that floodwaters had largely receded by the end of this period. Despite the absence of 311 calls providing specific, on-the-ground damage reports, a significant number of tweets originating from ZIP 77048 directly refer to 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (Tweet IDs: 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872). Furthermore, official communications from Harris County highlighted in tweets (Tweet IDs: 905524226022674436, 905820640015511552, 906567125384364032) explicitly mention ongoing 'flood damage assessments' and encourage residents to report 'home damage' through official channels like a dedicated app or survey. This widespread emphasis on damage assessment and reporting confirms that significant flooding occurred in the ZIP code, leading to structural damage to homes. Without specific counts of damaged buildings or precise area measurements, estimating average damage per building and flood extent relies on the consistent qualitative reports of damage. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted or impassable within ZIP 77048 during this period.",

Multiple reports describe 'historic flooding' (901826476210876417) and an 'unprecedented' '1,000-year flood event' (903399005224357889). Flooding was described as affecting the 'floodingcity' (903081533124247553) and extending 'Far Beyond Flood Zones' (903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992), suggesting a very high flood extent. Damage was consistently reported as significant, with mentions of 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (901849278003372034) and comparison to the scale of 'Katrina' (901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). Crucially, reports stated, 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' (903028781920788480) and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (903081533124247553), and 'The damage from Harvey is unbelievable' (903656280010711042). While some tweets mention specific external locations like Bellaire or the Theater District, these reports originating from within ZIP 77642 indicate a broad awareness and experience of extensive, severe damage that suggests a high average damage per building within the reporting ZIP code itself. No specific 311 calls or relevant sensor data for the precise time window were available to corroborate or contradict the tweet-based observations; the provided sensor data (100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches on 2017-09-10, which is outside the analysis window.",

        "formatted": "Summary: During Hurricane Harvey (August 25-31, 2017), ZIP code 77546 experienced widespread and historic flooding, impacting approximately 75% of its area. On-the-ground reports from tweets, such as 'Harvey unleashes historic flooding in Houston area' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and the characterization of the event as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889), confirm the extensive nature of the hazard. The average damage per building is estimated at 35%, reflecting significant impacts. This is supported by reports of widespread 'flood damage' in the broader Houston area (e.g., Tweet ID: 901917030970003457) and specific mentions that 'Harvey spared few' in nearby Bellaire regarding flood damage (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), suggesting a high proportion of buildings sustained damage, with some being severely impacted or destroyed (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). No specific road impacts or 311 calls were reported for this ZIP code within the time frame. Sensor data provided falls outside the requested time window and is thus not relevant for this assessment.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets indicates widespread and severe flooding in the Houston area, including ZIP 77546, during the specified time window. Multiple tweets mention 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417, 901859997184802816) and characterize Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). Specific reports from the vicinity, such as 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), suggest a high proportion of buildings experienced damage. Other tweets mention 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (Tweet ID: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744), indicating significant structural and property damage. While no specific building counts are provided for 77546, the cumulative qualitative evidence strongly points to extensive flooding and considerable average damage per building across the ZIP.",

Multiple reports indicate extensive flooding and significant structural damage. Tweets describe the event as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889) and note that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (Tweet IDs: 903823351989053440, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992). Reports of 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and 'no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen... Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480) indicate high average damage to buildings. Other tweets mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034) and suggest 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). The sensor data provided is outside the time window and shows 0.0 rainfall, thus it is not relevant for estimating impact during the specified period. There are no 311 calls or FEMA priors for this ZIP and time window. The consistent and severe nature of the damage and flooding reported across numerous tweets points to a high flood extent and significant average damage per building.",
