Tweet [904837837140484096] specifically mentions 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment' in Southwest Houston, which is within or directly adjacent to ZIP 77048, indicating localized flooding and damage.

([906567125384364032]). This widespread focus on damage reporting and assessment strongly suggests that a substantial portion of the ZIP experienced flooding and resulting structural damage to residential properties during the peak of Harvey, even though the water had receded by the query window.

Multiple tweets refer to 'historic flooding' and 'unbelievable damage' from Hurricane Harvey. Specifically, tweet 903081533124247553 states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot', indicating severe structural impact. Several tweets also mention 'water damage extended far beyond flood zones' (e.g., 903823717926567936, 903992796763348992), suggesting a broad flood extent. While some tweets refer to the Theater District or Bellaire, the prompt confirms all tweets are 'Confirmed in ZIP 77022', thus these reports are considered relevant to the overall impact context for this ZIP. No 311 calls were available. Sensor data from September 10th showing 0.0 inches indicates water receded *after* the primary impact period, consistent with the timing of Harvey's flooding and subsequent recession.",

References to 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' [902889458860785664] further confirm the severity within the broader Houston area. While sensor data from September 10 shows water had receded, it does not contradict the severe conditions reported during the query window of August 25-31. No specific roads were identified as impacted.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901323184695382017, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825\nReasoning: The provided tweets indicate widespread and historic flooding in the Houston area, including ZIP 77546, during the specified time window. Multiple tweets refer to significant 'flood damage' [901086383942639617, 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744] and 'historic flooding' [901826476210876417]. One tweet specifically notes 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' [902889458860785664] and another highlights the severity of damage in nearby Bellaire, stating, 'I have no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' [903028781920788480]. This phrase 'spared few' suggests a high proportion of buildings sustained damage. Additionally, a tweet mentioned 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' [903081533124247553]. The sensor data from September 10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by then, not that flooding didn't occur during the query window. Based on the overwhelming evidence of widespread and severe flooding and damage across the broader Houston area, including specific mentions of damage, high estimates for flood extent and average damage per building are justified. No specific roads were named as impacted in the provided data.",

This direct report, along with broader mentions of 'historic flooding' and 'unbelievable damage' within tweets geo-located to the ZIP, suggests a moderate flood extent across approximately 50% of the area and an average structural damage of about 25% per building, reflecting the severe impact on affected properties.
