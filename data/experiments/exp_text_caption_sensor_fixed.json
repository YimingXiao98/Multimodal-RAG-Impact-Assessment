This aligns with the critical instruction that sensor data showing 0.0 after peak flooding means water receded.

The 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' was reported multiple times (e.g., Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056). Tweets also explicitly state that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet IDs: 903823717926567936, 903992796763348992), indicating a very broad flood extent. The phrase 'Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480) further supports a high percentage of damaged properties. One tweet reports '77018 is without power and accessible from anywhere. No trucks to be found' (Tweet ID: 902555174073499650), suggesting significant infrastructure disruption including power outages and practical inaccessibility despite the confusing 'accessible from anywhere' phrasing. The sensor data for 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that date, but does not contradict the severe flooding reported during the active event period.",
