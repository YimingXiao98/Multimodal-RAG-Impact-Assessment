Text analysis reports that approximately 85% of the area was flooded, with an estimated damage severity of 75%. These estimates are based on numerous eyewitness accounts via social media. The visual imagery, however, did not confirm visible flooding or damage, likely due to timing of image capture relative to flood peak. Thus, flooding and damage estimates rely chiefly on the text reports.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.85\nCited Tweets: 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034\nReasoning: The text analysis indicates significant flooding and damage reports, supported by numerous tweets indicating the severity of the events associated with Hurricane Harvey. In contrast, the visual analysis failed to identify any flooding or structural damage. Given that the visual evidence may not capture all damage (especially internal damage), and is likely taken after floodwaters receded, the text assessment is prioritized for flood extent and damage severity estimates.",

        "formatted": "Summary: During the specified time window, ZIP code 77539 experienced severe flooding due to Hurricane Harvey, with reports indicating that approximately 85% of the area was flooded and structural damage was described as severe (estimated at 75%). While visual evidence primarily showed significant flooding, it did not reveal structural damage, likely due to internal damage that was not visible. Overall, the region faced historic devastation, supported by the high levels of citizen reporting.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.8\nCited Tweets: 902388226442264576, 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560\nReasoning: The text analysis indicates a high flood extent and significant structural damage based on multiple verified accounts, despite the visual assessment indicating no visible structural damage. The text reports are detailed and correlate well with the severity described in the visual aspects of flooding. Therefore, the unified assessment primarily reflects the confident assertions from text regarding flooding and damage severity while adjusting confidence slightly lower due to the conflicting visual assessment.",
