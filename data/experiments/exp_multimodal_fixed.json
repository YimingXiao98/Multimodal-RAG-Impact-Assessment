Multiple tweets confirm 'historic flooding' (Tweet 901826476210876417) and general 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet 901849278003372034). Specific locations like 'Waugh drive' and 'Spotts park' were reported to be flooded (Tweets 901899756414357508, 901901311779766272, 901901604969959424), and the 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' (Tweets 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560). A key report states that 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet 903081533124247553), indicating high severity of damage in affected areas. The consistent reporting of flood damage across various locations within the ZIP suggests a high flood extent and a substantial average damage per building.

The phrases 'historic flooding', 'spared few', and 'destroyed a lot' strongly suggest extensive flood coverage and high average structural damage across buildings in the area. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=75%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=45%, Visual=0%"
