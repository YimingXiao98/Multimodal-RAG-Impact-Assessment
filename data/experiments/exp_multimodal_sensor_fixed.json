The frequent mention of 'house damage' implies a noticeable average damage across buildings in the area. No specific roads were reported as impacted or impassable. There were no 311 calls for this ZIP during the period. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=60%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only",
