        "formatted": "Summary: From September 4 to September 10, 2017, ZIP code 77075 suffered notable damage due to Hurricane Harvey, as evidenced by numerous tweets documenting 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' and various ongoing flood damage assessments. Residents were encouraged to report damage, which highlighted substantial impacts from the flooding. Despite the visual analysis capturing no flooding or damage due to the timing of the images taken post-event, the text analysis remains the critical indicator of the damages sustained in the area.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.7\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: The text analysis indicated significant damage and flooding reports during the event period, while visual analysis taken after the flooding peak showed no visible signs. The discrepancy suggests that waters had receded prior to the imagery capture, reinforcing the credibility of text reporting. Thus, the flood extent is determined by text, while damage estimates are upheld based on text despite visual confirmation lacking.",
