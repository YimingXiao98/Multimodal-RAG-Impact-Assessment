The 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey' is repeatedly stated ([902889458860785664], [902933605168685056], [902946518239387648], [902967918874562560]). A rescue from '10210 CE King Pkwy, Houston, 77004' ([902680538586238981]) further confirms significant flood conditions requiring intervention. Tweets also highlight that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' ([903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], [903992796763348992]), suggesting a very high flood extent across the ZIP code. The tweet about 'the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' ([903028781920788480]), while mentioning Bellaire, was confirmed in ZIP 77004, indicating the widespread nature of severe damage observed by a person in the ZIP. Given the pervasive reports of 'historic flooding' and 'destroyed a lot' coupled with specific instances of damage and rescues, both flood extent and average damage per building are estimated to be high. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=85%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=45%, Visual=0%\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.45\nCited Tweets: 901976639000760320, 902177645340889089, 902680538586238981, 902835549135917056, 902889458860785664\nReasoning: Text evidence: The provided sensor data from 2017-09-10 shows 0.0 inches, indicating water recession after the peak flooding period, which includes the query window.

A particularly strong indicator is the report from nearby Bellaire (adjacent to 77025) stating 'no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few.' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), suggesting widespread and severe impact in the immediate vicinity. Additionally, power outages were reported in 77025 (Tweet IDs: 901916864099516416, 901920412006838272). The sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that date, which is after the query window and peak flooding, thus it does not contradict the reports of severe flooding during the event. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=75%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=35%, Visual=0%",

Several tweets ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]) discuss 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey May Match Katrina', indicating severe impact. Tweet [903081533124247553] states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity'. The repeated mention of 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' ([903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], [903992796763348992]) reinforces the widespread nature of the flooding and damage. A call for power restoration at 4931 Gammage St and 4927 Gammage St [902745578425253888] indicates infrastructure disruption, likely due to flood damage. The sensor data showing 0.0 inches on September 10th indicates water receded by then, not that flooding didn't occur during the peak event (Aug 27-28). Given the widespread reports of 'historic flooding' and 'destroyed a lot', a high flood extent and significant average damage per building are estimated. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=75%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=40%, Visual=0%",

Regarding damage, tweets explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (901849278003372034) and more critically, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (903081533124247553), suggesting significant average structural damage per building. Comparisons to Katrina's damage (901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) further emphasize the severity. While specific road impacts are not detailed, the widespread nature of the flooding implies general road disruption. Sensor data from September 10 showing 0.0 inches indicates that water had receded by that date, which is consistent with the query time window being during and immediately after the peak flooding. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=80%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only; Damage CONFLICT: Text=45%, Visual=0%",

Therefore, this sensor data is not indicative of the flood extent during the event. The primary evidence comes from numerous tweets within the specified ZIP code, describing widespread and severe flood damage. Tweets [902889458860785664], [902933605168685056], [902946518239387648], and [902967918874562560] specifically state 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey'. Tweet [903028781920788480] notes 'amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few', suggesting a high proportion of affected buildings. Tweet [903081533124247553] states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot', indicating high severity. Multiple tweets ([903399005224357889], [903422881648054277]) describe Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale'. Critically, tweets [903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], and [903992796763348992] confirm 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones', implying a very high flood extent across the ZIP. Tweet [903656280010711042] reinforces 'The damage from Harvey is unbelievable'. For roads, tweet [904837837140484096] directly mentions 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment'.

However, the query window (September 4-10, 2017) is after the peak flooding of Hurricane Harvey (Aug 27-28), so this sensor reading indicates recession, not absence of prior flooding. Numerous tweets from within this time window confirm significant flood impact and damage in ZIP 77407 due to Hurricane Harvey. Tweet [904837837140484096] specifically mentions 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment,' indicating localized severe impact. Multiple tweets (e.g., [905160043183693824], [905430986497945600], [905920666096078848], [906480493083983872]) refer to 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage,' and others mention 'flood damage assessments' (e.g., [905820640015511552]) and a 'Damage Report Feature Now On Harris County Appraisal District App' ([905524226022674436]), all pointing to widespread property damage. While specific counts of damaged buildings or precise flood depths are not provided, the consistent reporting of 'damage assessment' and 'house damage' suggests a significant portion of the area was affected by floodwaters, leading to considerable average structural damage per building. Fondren and Bissonnet are identified as impacted roads based on specific mention. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed | Conflicts noted: Flood CONFLICT: Text=40%, Visual=0% \u2192 Used text_only",

Given the widespread reports of 'house damage' and ongoing 'flood damage assessments,' it is estimated that a significant portion of the ZIP was flooded during the peak event and sustained notable average damage per building. No specific roads were identified as impacted by current flooding, consistent with the receding water levels. | Visual evidence: No imagery could be analyzed\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.4\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905152576756137984, 905160043183693824\nReasoning: Text evidence: The sensor data for ZIP 77058 during the time window of September 4-10, 2017 (sensor_id 170) shows 0.0 inches of water, indicating that floodwaters had receded in the area after the peak of Hurricane Harvey (August 27-28, 2017).
