Several tweets, such as [903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], and [903992796763348992], explicitly state that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones,' implying a broad flood extent across the area. Tweet [903656280010711042] describes the damage as 'unbelievable,' while others like [904122831713251328] and [905920666096078848] refer to 'property damage' and 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage,' and [905120736003727362] mentions 'Harvey flood waters damage Houston businesses.' These reports collectively suggest substantial water damage to both residential and commercial properties. Tweet [9058206400015511552] notes that 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress,' indicating ongoing efforts to quantify the widespread damage. The sensor data showing '0.0 inches' on 2017-09-10 is consistent with water receding after the peak flooding event (Aug 27-28), and does not contradict the significant flooding and damage reported in the tweets during the peak event. There were no 311 calls or FEMA prior knowledge provided for this specific ZIP and time window. No specific roads within ZIP 77017 were mentioned as directly impacted by flooding, although general damage assessments in Houston were noted.",

Multiple reports confirm 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID 901826476210876417) and describe Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID 903399005224357889), suggesting a very high flood extent. The statement 'Smoking a whole zip of gas..till the flood end..' (Tweet ID 901629053211480066) implies ongoing flooding during this period.

Therefore, this data does not contradict reports of flooding during the query period (August 29 - September 4). Tweets from within ZIP 77078 during this window provide strong evidence of widespread and severe impact. Multiple reports describe 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 902835549135917056), significant 'flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560), and that Hurricane Harvey 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). The phrase 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet ID: 903823717926567936) suggests a broad flood extent. The characterization of damage as 'unbelievable' (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042) further supports a high average damage severity across buildings in the ZIP. While specific counts of damaged buildings are not provided, the consistent language of widespread and severe destruction across multiple reports points to a significant proportion of the area being flooded and properties sustaining considerable damage.",

Based on these reports, an estimated 65% of the ZIP area was impacted by floodwaters, leading to an average structural damage of 35% per building. Roads, including Gammage St, and multiple unspecified roads were likely impacted or impassable due to the widespread flooding. Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches, confirms that water had receded by that later date, not that flooding was absent during the event.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.85\nCited Tweets: 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets indicates widespread and severe flooding in Houston, including ZIP 77021, during the specified time window.

Therefore, the sensor data does not contradict the occurrence of flooding during the event.\n\nTweet reports from within ZIP 77079 during the specified time window consistently describe widespread and severe impacts of Hurricane Harvey. Tweet ID 902835549135917056 mentions 'historic flooding,' while Tweet ID 903081533124247553 explicitly states, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity 8/30/17 Wednesday,' indicating significant destruction and flooding within the broad 'floodingcity' context observed from 77079.

While these specific locations are outside 77079, the fact that residents or sources in 77079 are reporting on such widespread damage across Houston highlights the immense scale of the disaster, making it highly probable that 77079 itself experienced similar, significant impacts.

The 'destroyed a lot' and 'unbelievable damage' statements suggest a considerable average damage percentage across buildings, even without specific counts for 77079.

No specific road impacts were reported for this ZIP.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.55\nCited Tweets: 902835549135917056, 902889458860785664, 902910691132280832, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648\nReasoning: Sensor data from September 10, 2017, showing 0.0 inches of water (sensor IDs 100, 105, 110), indicates that floodwaters had receded by that date, which is after the peak flooding of Hurricane Harvey (Aug 27-28) and also after the queried time window (Aug 29 - Sept 4). Therefore, the sensor data does not contradict the occurrence of flooding during the event.\n\nTweet reports from within ZIP 77079 during the specified time window consistently describe widespread and severe impacts of Hurricane Harvey. Tweet ID 902835549135917056 mentions 'historic flooding,' while Tweet ID 903081533124247553 explicitly states, 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity 8/30/17 Wednesday,' indicating significant destruction and flooding within the broad 'floodingcity' context observed from 77079. Multiple tweets (e.g., 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560) report on 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage from Harvey,' and Tweet ID 903028781920788480 mentions damage in Bellaire. While these specific locations are outside 77079, the fact that residents or sources in 77079 are reporting on such widespread damage across Houston highlights the immense scale of the disaster, making it highly probable that 77079 itself experienced similar, significant impacts. General statements like 'The damage from Harvey is unbelievable' (Tweet ID 903656280010711042) and 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet ID 903823717926567936) further support widespread impact.\n\nBased on these general but strong reports of 'historic flooding' and 'destroyed a lot' from sources within the ZIP, a moderate flood extent is estimated. The 'destroyed a lot' and 'unbelievable damage' statements suggest a considerable average damage percentage across buildings, even without specific counts for 77079. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted.",

Multiple tweets from this period, such as 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, and 906480493083983872, indicate significant 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage'. Tweet 904837837140484096 specifically mentions a 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston', suggesting localized but significant impact. The 'extent of Harvey damage' was a common theme (905435273726746624, 905450598950109185), and the Department of Neighborhoods was conducting 'flood damage assessments' (905820640015511552). While sensor data for September 10th (sensor_id 100, 105, 110) shows water levels at 0.0 inches, this indicates water recession from the earlier peak flooding, not an absence of flooding during the event. No specific roads were mentioned as impacted, and no 311 calls were found for this period. Based on the widespread reports of house and flood damage assessments, an estimated 50% of the ZIP area was impacted by floodwaters during Hurricane Harvey, leading to an estimated average damage of 35% per building across the ZIP.\nDamage Estimate: N/A%\nConfidence: 0.6\nCited Tweets: 904696071812784128, 904749993482969090, 904837837140484096, 905085480231993344, 905152576756137984\nReasoning: The provided tweets for ZIP 77063 within the 2017-09-04 to 2017-09-10 time window consistently report on the ongoing assessment and impact of Hurricane Harvey's damage, which peaked in late August. Tweets such as 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, and 906480493083983872 explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage'. Tweet 904837837140484096 refers to 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston', indicating specific localized impact. The 'extent of Harvey damage' is discussed in tweets 905435273726746624 and 905450598950109185, while 905820640015511552 mentions 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments in progress'. Although sensor data from September 10th (sensor_id 100, 105, 110) shows 0.0 inches, this indicates that floodwaters had receded by the query time window, not that flooding did not occur during the peak of Hurricane Harvey (Aug 27-28). The consistent reporting of flood and house damage assessments confirms a significant impact from earlier flooding. Due to the retrospective nature of the tweets (post-peak flooding) and lack of specific quantitative data on flood depth or number of damaged structures for this specific ZIP, estimations for flood extent and damage severity are based on the widespread qualitative reports of impact.",

Sensor data from 2017-09-10 showing 0.0 inches indicates water had receded by that date, consistent with the critical instructions for post-peak flood interpretation, and thus does not contradict reports of flooding during the query window. Tweets consistently report widespread flooding and significant damage within ZIP 77521. Tweet 901629053211480066 mentions 'till the flood end', while 903081533124247553 describes a '#floodingcity' and 'destroyed a lot', indicating active and extensive inundation. Furthermore, multiple tweets (e.g., 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465) explicitly state 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones', suggesting a high flood extent. The severity of damage is highlighted by phrases like 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (901849278003372034), 'destroyed a lot' (903081533124247553), 'unbelievable' damage (903656280010711042), and 'Harvey spared few' (903028781920788480). Although some tweets mention other cities (e.g., Bellaire, Theater District Houston), they are confirmed to originate from or be related to ZIP 77521 as per the provided data, and their content reinforces the regional widespread damage.

A specific report from August 30 (Tweet ID: 902855359995539457) explicitly states that residents at 1507 Chapman St, Orange, Tx 77630 were 'flooded in and can't get help,' directly confirming residential flooding and impassable roads within the ZIP. Multiple other tweets, confirmed for ZIP 77630, describe Hurricane Harvey as a 'historic flooding' event (Tweet ID: 902835549135917056) and a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889). Critically, reports state that 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and 'Harvey spared few' in areas suffering flood damage (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480). The phrasing 'widespread damage' (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042) and 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (multiple tweets) further supports extensive impact. Based on these on-the-ground reports, a substantial portion of the ZIP was likely covered by floodwaters, leading to high average structural damage per building. The sensor data from September 10 showing 0.0 inches confirms that water had receded well after the peak flooding event (Aug 27-28) and the query window, not that flooding didn't occur.",

Multiple tweets reported 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (e.g., Tweet IDs 905160043183693824, 905430986435685888, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872). There were calls for residents to report 'flood damage' and 'home damage' (Tweet IDs 905820640015511552, 906567125384364032), alongside general discussions of Harvey's 'flooding impact' (Tweet ID 905152576756137984) and the 'extent of Harvey damage' (Tweet ID 905435273726746624). A power outage was also reported (Tweet ID 905396985242542085). Sensor data (Sensor ID 170) from this period showed 0.0 inches of water, confirming that floodwaters had receded by this time rather than indicating an absence of prior flooding. Based on these reports, it is estimated that approximately 25% of the ZIP area was affected by floodwaters during the peak event, resulting in an average damage severity of 20% per building. No specific roads were identified as impacted."

The sensor data (ID 170) showing 0.0 inches during this later period confirms that floodwaters had receded. However, numerous tweets explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (e.g., Tweet IDs 905160043183693824, 905430986497945600, 905920666096078848, 906480493083983872) and discuss 'flood damage assessments in progress' (Tweet ID 905820640015511552). Residents were also encouraged to report 'home damaged in Harvey' (Tweet ID 906567125384364032) and the zip code was identified as 'affected by Hurricane Harvey' (Tweet ID 906908668322512896).
