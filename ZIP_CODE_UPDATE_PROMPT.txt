Update the paper to correctly reflect ZIP code counts:

- 139 ZIPs: Have complete ground truth (both flood extent AND damage data)
- 149 ZIPs: Total evaluated (50 dev + 99 test, no overlap)
- 10 ZIPs: Have flood extent data but NOT damage data (included in evaluation for extent metric only)

When updating:
- Use "139 ZIPs" when referring to damage ground truth coverage or complete ground truth
- Use "149 ZIPs" when referring to total evaluation set
- The dataset_stats table already correctly shows "139 ZIPs" for PDE - keep this
- Add clarification: "Evaluation covers 149 ZIPs total, with 139 ZIPs having complete ground truth for both metrics"

Check all sections (introduction, methodology, experiments, results) and ensure consistent usage of these numbers.
